The Prework Study Guide is designed to help users explore and understand key topics in web development. Here's how you can make the most of this guide:

Sections: The webpage is divided into sections, each focusing on a specific topic. Currently, it covers HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. You can read each section to get information related to that topic.

DevTools Console: To interact with JavaScript functionality, open your browser's DevTools console. Upon loading the webpage, JavaScript will execute and provide information about the topics covered during prework.

Random Topic Selector: The JavaScript code selects a random topic from the list of topics (HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript) and suggests which topic you should study first. It's a fun way to decide where to begin your learning journey.

Header and Footer: The header and footer sections provide a consistent user interface with a blue background and white text. The header includes a title, an image, and a message inviting you to open the console for interactive content. The footer contains a motivational message.

Feel free to explore the content, use it as a reference, and interact with the JavaScript functionality. This study guide is here to enhance the understanding of basic web development concepts.
